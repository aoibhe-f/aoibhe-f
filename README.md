Hi, I'm Bo! I'm a grad student working on my Master's in Computer Science.<br>

I am primarily interested in computer graphics, moreso visualization than games.

My free time is mostly spent working on my 2D graphics engine for C++, Yagi.<br>
I'm also well-versed in Python, especially for automation.
