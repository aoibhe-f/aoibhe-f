Hi, I'm Bo!

I am primarily interested in computer graphics, moreso visualization than games. I work primarily in C++.<br>
I'm also well-versed in Python, especially for automation, and I have dabbled in a number of other languages (C#, Ruby, etc).<br>
I've also done some limited projects on the HTML/CSS/JS stack.

In my free time, I work on a C++ 2D graphics engine, [Baphy](https://github.com/bogicide/baphy).<br>
I also like to make [pixel fonts](https://github.com/bogicide/fonts) occasionally.

Non-programming hobbies include mechanical keyboards, anime, and some video games--I particularly like narrative-focused ones.<br>
日本語を勉強しています。 I am still very much a beginner, though!

I have a [devblog](https://hash-collision.com) where I sometimes talk about things that were more interesting to implement.
Articles are sparse right now, but I'm hoping to add more in the future!
