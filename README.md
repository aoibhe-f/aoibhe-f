Hi, I'm Bo! I'm a grad student working on my Master's.<br>
I use `they/them` pronouns.

I am primarily interested in computer graphics.

My free time is mostly spent working on my 2D graphics/game engine for C++, Hades.<br>
I'm also experienced in Python.

I keep a small blog at www.peachesandplums.blog<br>
You can find me on Twitter @6eauregardes
