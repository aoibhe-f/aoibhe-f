Hi, I'm Beau(regarde)! I'm a grad student working on my Master's in Computer Science.<br>

I am primarily interested in computer graphics, moreso visualization than games.

My free time is mostly spent working on my 2D graphics engine for C++, Myco, or whatever I happen to be calling it now.<br>
I'm also well-versed in Python, especially for automation.

I have a [devblog](https://hash-collision.com) where I sometimes talk about things that were more interesting to implement.
It's also just a normal blog, I put non-dev things on there as well.
