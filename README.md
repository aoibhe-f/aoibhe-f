Hi, I'm Beau(regarde)! I'm a grad student working on my Master's in Computer Science.<br>

I am primarily interested in computer graphics, moreso visualization than games. I work primarily in C++.<br>
I'm also well-versed in Python, especially for automation, and I have dabbled in a number of other languages (C#, Ruby, etc).<br>
I've done some limited projects on the HTML/CSS/JS stack, though nothing with any frameworks.

In my free time, I work on a C++ 2D graphics engine called Myco.<br>
Non-programming hobbies include mechanical keyboards, anime, occasional chess, and some video games.<br>
日本語を勉強しています。I am still very much a beginner, though!

I have a [devblog](https://hash-collision.com) where I sometimes talk about things that were more interesting to implement.
It's also just a normal blog, I put non-dev things on there as well.
