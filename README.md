Hi, I'm Bo! I'm a grad student working on my Master's in Computer Science.<br>
I am non-binary and use `they/them` pronouns, please.

I am primarily interested in computer graphics.

My free time is mostly spent working on my 2D graphics/game engine for C++, Hades.<br>
I'm also well-versed in Python, especially for automation.

I keep a small blog [here](https://www.peachesandplums.blog), and you can find me on Twitter @6eauregardes
